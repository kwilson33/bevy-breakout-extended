# Bevy-Breakout-Extended

This repository houses my 'extended' version of the breakout game example from the [Bevy repository](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)


## Features added
* Add ability to shoot balls.
* Add Ammo text.

My plan is to make changes so I can learn how the Bevy engine works.

## Planned work
* Add collision for the new shot balls.
* Implement ammo system so you can only shoot certain amount of balls.
* Create levels.
* Create start screen.
* Add different bricks that need to be hit multiple times.
